md`# 2022 30-day Map Challenge • Day 17 • A Map Without A Computer • 🧝🏽‍♀️ Middle Earthcadia`
```

```{ojs}
md`A few years ago, I went **ABSOLUTELY GAGA** over Dan Bell's [Middle Earth-style Maps of Modern Places](https://www.maproomblog.com/2018/09/maps-middle-earth-style-by-hand-and-by-arcgis/).

#2 noticed this (I mean, folks on Tycho Station likely couldn't help but notice), and managed to surprise me with one of the most amazing birthday presents ever: a series of her own take on these hand-drawn maps, but of DownEast Maine and Acadia National Park — my favourite spot on this planet of ours. It took her just under nine months to finish the entire set.

So, while this is not something I drew, it's way better than anything these busted mitts of mine could ever produce on their own.

Extra points (perhaps, even some Maine swag) if you can drop a comment with what part of Acadia this is.`
