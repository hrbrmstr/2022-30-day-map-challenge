md`# 2022 30-day Map Challenge â€¢ Day 10 â€¢ ðŸ˜’ Bad Maps`
```

```{ojs}
md`I went to the internets looking for inspiration, starting on [Kagi](https://kagi.com) for a search for "bad". That wasn't very helpful, so I shunted the query to Google, and ended up with a similar bupkis state. So, I tossed "bad" into Google Trends to see if there would be some useful topic prompts with "bad" in them. While there might have been, I found a sufficiently bad map right in front of my eyes that I'm using for today's entry.

Hit up [this gTrends link](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bad&geo=US), scroll down til you get to the map, and choose "Metro" for the subregion. I used Developer Tools to find and extract the SVG element.

This is supposed to be "helpful" by showing interest in the term "bad" by U.S. metro region. (Data is below the chart).

I'm making this bad map even worse by not putting a legend on it and changed the metro area outline color, but the original is wretched all on its own, partly due to the map being generated by a fairly mindless automaton vs an actual human.

Some bad points:

- No legend
- No title
- No explanatory text
- WGS84 projection despite repositioning Alaska and Hawaii (Albers USA FTW)
- The borders blend with the choropleth color and make values harder to distinguish
- "Metro area" shapes are not widely known outside of geo wonks`
